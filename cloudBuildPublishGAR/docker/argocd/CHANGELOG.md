# Changelog

All notable changes to `argocd/tools/evoiqctl` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The BASE SEMVER for this file is taken from the `Dockerfile` in this repository.  In our
CHANGELOG entries we increment a `-#` to the matching SEMVER from the `Dockerfile`, and
the highest (first encountered) matching entry is used to TAG the built docker image and
is pushed into ghcr.io.
